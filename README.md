# Car_Fuel_Log_Excel_Dashboard

## Scenario:
Suppose that you have kept a detailed fuelling log of your car throughout the year 2020, listing the 
date of each time you had filled your fuel tank, the milage reading at the time, how many gallons of 
fuel you purchased, and how much the fuel cost.

To determine some of the seasonal trends that affect how efficiently your car runs, you have 
converted all your data into a spreadsheet named Xander Fuel. Using this spreadsheet, you can now 
identify trends hidden in data and produce meaningful charts.

# Exercises:
1. Your friend Alex is interested in buying your car and wants to know how 
many kilometres your car accumulated on each date, the price per 
gallon at each fuelling, and the fuel economy which can be found 
through calculating miles per gallon (MPG).
Create an interactive report for Alex that identifies key trends in the data 
and produces appropriate outputs including charts. Make sure that
charts are formatted appropriately by displaying dates and titles in a
suitable format, and format the data to be user-friendly.

2. Alex wants to know further about the cost of fuel for your car.
Create a function with a date input that would provide the fuel cost for 
selected dates from a drop-down list and make an additional drop-down 
list that filters the sum of cost for each quarter of the year
